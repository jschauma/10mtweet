  <h2>What?</h2>
  <p>
    This is a service that allows you to show somebody that you "liked"
    their tweet, without having to reveal who you are.
    You can either use this page, or directly <tt>POST</tt> a
    <tt>msg=</tt> value to
    <tt>https://10mtweet.netmeister.org/anonylike/post.cgi</tt>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was very haphazardly slapped together by <a
    href="https://twitter.com/jschauma">@jschauma</a> after seeing <a
    href="https://twitter.com/actioncookbook/status/697876267895558144">this
    tweet</a>.  There's more work to be done, since an account can only
    "like" a tweet once.  I'll think about how else to express likes,
    possibly by quoting a tweet in some form.  Check back later.
  </p>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <p>
    Anonymous speech is <a
    href="https://twitter.com/jschauma/status/448081836796030976">important</a>.
    I already have a tool that allows you to <a href="../">anonymously tweet a
    self-destructing message</a>, so why not also allow people to "like" a
    message?
  </p>
  <h2>How?</h2>
  <p>
    This is, as you can tell, rather, uhm, low-frills.  Simple.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's this HTML page and a perl CGI.  The perl CGI effectively just
    feeds the message ID to my <a
    href="https://www.netmeister.org/apps/tweet/">tweet(1)</a>
    command-line client.
  </p>
  <p>
    There's a virtual host on my regular web server with its own
    certificate (so SNI is required), and a custom log format (IP
    addresses and client identification is never logged), and that's about
    it.
  </p>
    If you find a problem with anything, please <a
    href="mailto:jschauma@netmeister.org">let me know</a>.
